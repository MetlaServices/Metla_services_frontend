        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6">Why Is It So Important to Find the Right Talent?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Having the right employees for any organization is a critical success factor in any business organization. However, if you can hire an employee who has the right company targets and values, they can push your business forward immensely.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          However, having an open position might not be of any benefit to your firm as it will make your company lose time and even money. By not filling the job each day, your business may lose potential sales or growth opportunities, and other employees are tasked with extra work.
